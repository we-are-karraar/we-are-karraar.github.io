        <h1 class="header">SolaX</h1>
        <h5 class="grid-middle summary">SolaX is a clean energy company, helping customers to develop off grid solar electricity storage. They have grown year over year and having offices in Netherlands, Germany, Australia and the USA. Over a period of 10 years they have become the leading provider of inverter systems for solar systems. </h5>
        <h2>What did the company want to achieve</h2>
        <p class="grid-middle">The company had an existing call center in Australia and wanted to onboard their European call center on Twilio Flex platform. They also wanted to take advantage of call overflow across regions and route calls to less busy call centers. Furthermore they wanted to pull in data directly from their CRM system</p>
        <h2>How did we help them</h2>
        <p class="grid-middle">Karraar helped SolaX define the rules for call overflow to take into account of business hours across two different time zones. Furthermore we simplified the call flow for the customer to handle incoming calls from different countries and developed a routing based on agent skills. Since we had the capability to develop both the backend and frontend we provided a one stop solution for the customer for all its development need. </p>
        <p class="grid-middle">We also updated the agent UI to pull data from the CRM to appear in the correct format when an incoming call came in. </p>
